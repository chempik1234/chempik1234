My main language is **Python** which I've been learning for approx. 4-5 years
- :snake: Speaking of **python**, I primarily use **Django & DRF** but I'm also familiar with **FastAPI & Flask, PyQT5 & tkinter** and many simple libraries
- planning to learn **K8S** and master **FastAPI** as a faster backend framework.
- I know the basics of **native JS**
- I'm familiar with **Docker (-compose)**, **Redis**, **gRPC**, **ElasticSearch** and microservice architecture (this list is going to be extended later)
- :nut_and_bolt: I have also written some things in **C#** (WPF, Unity, ASP.NET, MAUI) but I'm not a pro here
  
  Edit: I've just participated in a competition where I had to make a **Unity VR** game, so I can make Unity games in **C#**
- ðŸ“— Here go the basics of the other languages, such as Java, C++, SQL etc. that I'm not planning to ever use.
