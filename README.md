## ‚ùó Disclaimer: Speaking of Python, the cool code and big projects are PRIVATE, so there're simplier projects left for you to see

My main language now is **Golang**, the great and precious.

I used to have **Python** as the main language, I had been learning it for approx. 4-5 years (My commercial experience is approx. a year)

- :snake: Speaking of **python**, I primarily use **Django/DRF** and **FastAPI** but I'm also familiar with **Flask, PyQT5 & tkinter** and many simple libraries
- I'm currently learning **Go**, an if you do it too, [check this stepik course out](https://stepik.org/course/187490) and especially [this one](https://lyceum.yandex.ru/web-go) if you're a russian student under 19.
 
- I'm familiar with **NGINX**, **Docker (-compose)**, **Redis**, **gRPC**, **RabbitMQ**, **ElasticSearch**, **Clickhouse**, hexagonal (ports-based) architecture and microservice architecture (this list is going to be extended later)
- :nut_and_bolt: I have also written some things in **C#** (WPF, Unity, ASP.NET, MAUI) but I'm not a pro here, I mean at all.
  
- üìó Here go the basics of the other languages, such as JS, C#, Swift, Java, Lua, C++ etc. that I'm not planning to ever use.
